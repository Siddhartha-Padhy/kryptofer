What's better than a decentralized ethereum transaction service? Kryptofer is a smart-contract based website built with ReactJS which serves 
the above mentioned purpose. The website requires [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn/related)
chrome extension in order to send and record any transactions.
